# Keeper App

This is a Google Keep clone for the React tutorial for the "Web Development Bootcamp"
course on Udemy.

I extended this tutorial by creating a backend using Express and connecting it to
MongoDB Atlas as the database. The app is currently hosted on Heroku and can be found here: https://calm-ravine-09523.herokuapp.com/


### Running the app

To run the app locally on your machine you will need to create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and replace the connection in the "server.js" file"
